Ultimately it’s a waste of energy and is counterproductive toward maintaining a steady, consistent everyday routine. Oh really? You’re gonna spend $400 on one dinner that takes you all day to make of which 75% will spoil in the form of uneaten leftovers just to impress the group sad, sorry degenerates who share your same, shitty DNA that got invited over out of tradition and guilt. Nah dawg not for me. I’m gonna treat this Thursday as a nice little surprise day off with nothing out of the ordinary other than a sincere appreciation that our ancestors had the cojones to take this land by force and claim it as their own so that their lineage could live out their futures in an completely disconnected alternate online reality. Amen.",
